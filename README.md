### Project Description
BirdBnB is a quirky web app where birds can book nests like resorts, share co-living spaces, or even build their own cozy homes using natural materials. It’s like Airbnb — but for birds! 🐦✨

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
(but what if the problem does exist?)Hey there, feathered friend.
Tired of fighting over the same old tree? Can’t find a nest that matches your vibe? Rooming with cuckoos who never clean their twigs? You deserve better.

Whether you're a migrating sparrow or a homebody heron, BirdBnB is here to fix your nest stress.
💼 Book luxurious resorts.
👯 Share cozy co-living nests with like-minded beaks.
🛠️ Or build your dream nest with premium sticks and strategic leaf placement.

No more winging it.
Your perfect nest is just a chirp away. 🐦✨

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing BirdBnB – a full-service sky-high sanctuary system.
We built a fully-functioning real-estate app… for birds.

✨ Booking: Browse premium nests with leaf-woven luxury and sky-high ratings.
🐤 Co-living: Share twigs with other birds, from party pigeons to introvert owls.
🌳 Nest-Building: Choose your dream location, favorite materials, and even the neighborhood vibe (no crows, we promise).

No logins. No payments. Just feathers, fluff, and pure frontend-backend love.
It’s Airbnb, but fluffier.
